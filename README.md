# Flutter Frontend Design Gallery

This repository showcases a variety of frontend UI designs built using Flutter. It includes both original layouts created by me and practice clones based on public Figma designs. The goal is to explore UI development, improve design implementation skills, and share reusable templates with others.

## Features

- Original UI concepts designed from scratch  
- Practice clones of Figma designs  
- Responsive layouts for multiple screen sizes  
- Clean, modular, and readable Flutter code

## Project Structure

Each design is organized into its own directory. Some example categories include:
- Login and Signup Screens  
- Home and Dashboard Pages  
- E-commerce Interfaces  
- Profile and Settings Pages  

## Tech Stack

- Flutter (Dart)  
- Common packages: `google_fonts`, `flutter_svg`, `provider`, etc.  
- No backend functionality; this is a frontend-only collection
